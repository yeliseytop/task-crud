## Install
To install the app follow the instruction:

cd task-crud
git checkout task-crud

```

## Run
You need to use REST client for work with API, fore example: [Postman](https://www.postman.com)

- Run the app in development mode:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
- Or run the app in production mode:
```bash
npm run start:prod
```

API path is `api/users`, that has to be used with request method `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.

Implemented endpoint `api/users`:
    - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons
        - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records
    - **GET** `api/users/{userId}` 
        - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and and record with `id === userId` if it exists
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
    - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database
        - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields
    - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user
        - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record
        - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
    - **DELETE** `api/users/{userId}` is used to delete existing user from database
        - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist

Users are stored as `objects` that have following properties:
    - `id` — unique identifier (`string`, `uuid`) generated on server side
    - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**)
    - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)
    - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)
